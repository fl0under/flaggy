  "description": "Heap exploitation challenge (rehost of 0ctf2017) provided as a binary plus a matching libc (libc-2.23.so). Analyze the babyheap binary and use glibc heap techniques (e.g., use-after-free, fastbin/unsorted-bin manipulation, overwrite malloc/free hooks or GOT/return addresses) to achieve code execution and recover the flag. The repository includes DESCRIPTION.md and REHOST.md with full challenge and run instructions; use the provided libc when testing locally.",
