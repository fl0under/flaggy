Basic Buffer Overflow Challenge

This is a simple buffer overflow vulnerability. The program reads user input without bounds checking.

Your goal is to:
1. Analyze the binary to find the vulnerability
2. Determine the buffer size and return address offset
3. Craft a payload to redirect execution
4. Extract the flag

Tools you might need:
- file, checksec (binary analysis)
- gdb (debugging and finding offsets)
- python3 with pwntools (payload crafting)
- strings (finding hardcoded data)

The flag is in the format: picoCTF{...}
