Buffer Overflow Without Strings

This challenge is similar to the basic buffer overflow, but with a twist:

- The program reads raw bytes using read(0, ...) so your payload can include null bytes.
- The flag and success message are not present as plain ASCII in the binary.

Your goal is to:
1. Analyze the binary to find the vulnerability
2. Determine the buffer size and exact offset to overwrite control flow
3. Craft a payload that includes binary data (e.g., null bytes) to redirect execution
4. Trigger the hidden win path to reveal the flag

Notes:
- The usual strings(1) approach won't help you here.
- You may need to use gdb/gef or pwntools for crafting the payload.

Flag format: picoCTF{...}
